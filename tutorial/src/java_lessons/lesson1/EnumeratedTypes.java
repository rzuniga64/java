/**
 * An enumerated data type is a programmer defined data type.
 * It consists of values known as enumerators. Example:
 * - Day is a data type, itâ€™s values are:
 * - MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY
 * - Operations that work over enum values:
 * - =, ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, can use as case labels in switch stmt
 *
 * When the enum is declared public inside a class, the typename and values must include the class name and scope
 * resolution operator outside the class
