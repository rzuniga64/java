/**
 * Data Type:
 * − set of values
 * − set of operations over those values
 *
 * example: Integer− whole numbers, -32768 to 32767
 *
 * operations: Which operation is not valid for float?
 * − +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, ...
 *
 * Scalar data types (atomic values)
 * Arithmetic types
 *  Integer
 *  - short
 *  - int
 *  - long
 *
 *  Floating points
 *  - float
 *  - double
 *  - long double
 *
 *  Composite types:
 *  Arrays: ordered sequence of values of the same Strings
 *
 *  First class objects
 *  first-class objects can be manipulated in the usual ways without special cases and exceptions
 *  - copy (=, assignment)
 *  - comparison (==, <, ...)
 *  - input/output (<<, >>)
 *
 *  first-class object: string class, vector class (standard library)
 *  size() member function
 *  ==, <, +
 *
 *  Second class objects
 *  second-class objects can be manipulated only in restricted ways, may have to define operations yourself
 *  - Usually primitive (built-in) data types
 *
 *  second-class object: C-String (char array)
 *  - strcpy
 *  - strlen
 *  - strcat
 *  - strcmp
 *
 * primitive array
 * = does not copy elements
 * - length undefined
 * - ==, <, ... do not perform as expected
