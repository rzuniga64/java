- An object-oriented program is a collection of loosely connected objects
  interacting with each other. 
- An object encapsulates behavorial.state (data) and behavior (operations)
- A class defines an object's behaviour
- A class can be defined as a user-defined type
- Classes can be linked to each other using a hierarchical structure
- Classes higher up in the structure pass behavorial.state and behavior to lower
  classes
- An object-oriented program is a collection of objects where each object
  has it's own set of responsibilities
- Objects form the basis of reusable software since an object can be used
  in any program that needs the object.
