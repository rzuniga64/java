When you want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviours in a alist.

I want the class object to be able to choose from
    -   Not flying
    -   Fly with wings
    -   Fly supeer fast

-   When you need to use one of several behaviors dynamically
-   Often reduces long list of conditionals
-   Avoids duplicate code
-   Keeps class changes from forcing other class changes
-   Can hide complicated/secret code from the user
-   Negative: Increased number of Objects/Classes
