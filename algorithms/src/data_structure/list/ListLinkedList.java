 * Advantages of linked lists over arrays
 * 1. A linked list can grow or shrink in size.
 * 2. The programmer doesn't need to predict how many values could be in teh list.
 * 3. The programmer doesn't need to resize and copy the list when it reaches a certain capacity.
 * 4. When a value is inserted into or deleted from a linked list, none of the other nodes have to be moved.
