/**
 * WHY USE RECURSION?
 *
 *  It is true that recursion is never required to solve a problem
 *  Any problem that can be solved with recursion cab also be solved using iteration.
 *  Recursion requires extra overhead: function call + return mechanism uses extra resources
 *  However some repetitive problems are more easily and naturally solved with recursion
 *  Iterative solution may be unreadable to humans
 *
 *  Recursion is the primary method of performing repetition in most functional languages.
 *
 *  Once programmers adapt to solving problems using recursion, the code produced is generally shorter, more elegant,
 *  easier to read and debug.
 *
 *  HOW TO WRITE RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
 *  Branching is required!! (If or switch)
 *  Find a base case
 *  - one (or more) values for which the result of the function is known (no repetition required to solve it)
 *  Develop the recursive case
 *  - For a given argument (say n), assume the function works for a smaller value (n-1).
 *  - Use the result of calling the function on n-1 to form a solution for n
 *
 *  Many recursive functions (over integers) look
 *  like this:
 *  type f(int n) {
 *	    if (n==0)
 *		    // do the base case
 *	    else
 *		    // ... f(n-1) ...
 *      ! Note these functions are undefined for n < 0.
