/*
 * 	Selection Sort
 *	There is a pass for each position (0..size-1)
 *	On each pass, the smallest (minimum) element in the rest of the list is exchanged (swapped) with element at the
 *	current position. The first part of the list (already processed) is always sorted. Each pass increases the size
 *	of the sorted portion
 *
 * 	Runtime analysis
 * 	Best    Average     Worst
 * 	O(n*n)  O(n*n)      O(n*n)
 *
 *	Array Position	0 	1	2	3	4
 *	Initial State	36	24	10	6	12
 *	After 1st pass	6 	24	10	36	12	6 and 36 are swapped
 *	After 2nd pass	6 	10 	24	36	12	10 and 24 are swapped
 *	After 3rd pass	6	10	12	36	24	12 and 24 are swapped
 *	After 4th pass	6 	10	12	24	36	24 and 36 are swapped
*
*	N is the number of elements in the list
*	Outer loop executes N-1 times
*	Inner loop executes N-1, then N-2, then N-3, ... then once.
*	Total number of comparisons (in inner loop) is the sum of 1 to N-1 is N(N + 1) /2
*	Efficiency of algorith is O(N2)
