/**
 *  Shell sort is a sub quadratic algorithm whose code is only slightly longer than the insertion sort, making it the
 *  simplest of the faster algorithms. It compares elements that are far apart and then by comparing elements that are
 *  less far apart, and so on, gradually shrinking toward the basic insertion sort.  Shell sort is known as a
 *  diminishing gap sort. When gap is 1 the loop is identical to an insertion sort.
 *
 *  The running time of Shell sort depends heavily on the choice of increment sequences.  A sequence which performs well
 *  in practice but has no theoretical basis, is to have a starting gap of N/2.2. This divisor appears to bring the
 *  average running time to below O(pow(N, 5/4)).  For 100, 000, to 1,000,000 items, it typically improves performance
 *  by about to 25 to 35 percent over Shell's Increments, although nobody knows why.  The performance of Shell sort is
 *  quite acceptable in practice, even for N in the tens of thousands. The simplicity of the code makes it the algorithm
 *  of choice for sorting up to moderately large input.  it is also a fine example of a very simple algorithm with an
 *  extremely complex analysis.
