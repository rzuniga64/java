/**
 *  Stacks are used to complete a task and are soon after discarded.
 *
 *  StackArray
 *  1.  StackArray is a data structure that holds a collection of elements of the same type.
 *  2.  Allowa only a single item to be added or removed at a time
 *  3.  Allows access to the last item inserted, first out (LIFO)
 *  4.  Problem: No random access to other elements
 *	5.  StackArray overflow: Trying to push an item onto a full stack
 *  6. 	StackArray underflow: Trying to pop an item from an empty stack
 *
 *  STACK OPERATIONS
 *  Operations: These operations should take constant time O(1)
 *
 *  isEmpty: true if the stack currently contains no elements
 *  isFull: true if the stack is currently full, i.e.,has no more space to hold additional elements
 *  push: add a value onto the top of the stack. Make sure it is not full first.
 *  pop: remove (and return) the value from the top of the stack. Make sure it is not empty first.
 *  peek:
 *  pushMany(String multipleValues):
 *  popAll():
 *  popDisplayAll():
 *  displayTheStack():
 *
 *  This oporation should take linear time O(n)
 *  makeEmpty: removes all the elements
