Regular Expressions are strings of characters that represent a character sequence.

We call that character sequence with a regex a character class.
For example if the word that is looked for is the word 'Java'
in a text then the word 'Java' would be the character class.
The character class would specify the pattern we are looking for.

character class - {Java}
wildcard character = . (dot) matches any character

quantifiers specify matches that can be made.
+ match one or more of the character class
Example: Ja+ match one or more character sequences of 'Ja'

* match zero or more
Example: ie* match zero or more character sequences of 'ie'

? match zero or more
Example: J?? match any two characters after 'J'
