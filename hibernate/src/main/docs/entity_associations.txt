Entity Associations
-   Provide mapping metadata for various associations.
-   Map collections of entity types.
-   Understand bidirectional and unidirectional relationships.
-   Reference from one entity to another.
-   Mapped to underlying database tables that support the relationship.
-   Source Object(Transaction)/Target Object(Account). ACCOUNT_ID is the foreign key in the Transaction table which
    it the Target object.
-   Bidirectional/Unidirectional relationships.

Important Lesson Notes
-   Relationship/Associated used interchangeably
-   Owning Entity/Non-Owning Entity
    -   The join column on one makes it the owning entity. With each association there are going to be two entities.
    -   The owning entity corresponds with the entity whose associated table contains the foreign key column.
        Always true in bidirectional relationships but not always in unidirectional relationships.

Types of Entity Associations
-   One to One: one account is associated with one set of credentials.
-   One to Many: one account is associated with many transactions.
-   Many to One: many transactions are associated with one account.
-   Many to Many: Many users can be associated with many accounts.
