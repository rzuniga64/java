Hibernate API: 3 major pillars that make up a Hibernate application
1.  Hibernate configuration
2.  Mapping metadata on the entities
3.  Invoking persistence operations

-   Learn to invoke persistence manager methods that manage CRUD operations and transactions.  Within Hibernate the
    main interface that we will be looking at is the Session interface which will allow us to perform those database
    operations and manage the persistence lifecycle.
-   Understand the persistence lifecycle or the different states our entities transition into and out of. Depending
    on where the sit within that lifecycle will determine if we can sync their state with the database.
-   Become familiar with interfaces in the Hibernate API.

Important Lesson Notes
-   Hibernate Session vs JPA EntityManager
-   populate.sql will truncate all of the tables so all the records will be lost. It will then insert a few records
    into the Bank table that we can work against.
