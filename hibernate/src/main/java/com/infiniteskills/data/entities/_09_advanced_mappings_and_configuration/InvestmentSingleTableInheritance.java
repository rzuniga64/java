@Entity
// @Inheritance is a JPA annotation.  The SINGLE_TABLE strategy means that we will take every field in our entity
// and associate with a column upon a single table. What we have done is taken all of the fields within our stock
// and our bond entities and we have placed them in the investment table. We see the common and distinct fields
// within the two entities. What will happen as we populate this table some of the fields will just wind up being
// null. When we insert a bond into the database we will not be specifying a share price. When we insert a stock
// we won't be specifying the interest rate on the stock. So its a trade. Sometimes we'll just have to accept there
// be some null values within this table. Some DBAs may not like that but they may not like the alternative of a
// TABLE_PER_CLASS strategy where we are going to duplicate a lot of fields. Its always a tradeoff when mapping
// inheritance.
@Inheritance(strategy= InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
// @DiscriminatorColumn is a column that will reside within the inheritance table that will be used to discern the
// the type of investment we are working with. So there be a value put in that column for stock and one for bond.
