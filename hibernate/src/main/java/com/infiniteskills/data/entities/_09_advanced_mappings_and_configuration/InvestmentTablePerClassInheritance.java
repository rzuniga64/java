@Entity
// @Inheritance is a JPA annotation.  The TABLE_PER_CLASS strategy mean that we will have a table for each of our
// concrete classes. We will have a table for Bond and a table for Stock. This very similar to using the mapped
// superclass strategy but now we will be able to use the Investment type within associations and queries.

    // specify our @Id within the abstract class Investment.  This will serve as the identifier for the bond and
    // stock entities.
    //
    // Disadvantage: Hibernate has to perform a union. When we have just two records that is not a big deal. But
    // if there were thousands of records the union operation is going to get expensive. So there is a price to
    // pay with table per class inheritance.
